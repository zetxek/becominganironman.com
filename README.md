# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/927b5698-66b6-450f-a9c9-5b85ebb2b1da/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pathtoironman/deploys)

My blog about triathlon training in my path to participate in my first long distance triathlon, a full IronMan event.

Tech-wise, it's a playground for some technology I wanted to test-drive:

- [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
